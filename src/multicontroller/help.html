                <span class="qtn">I can select the windows but nothing is happening when I try to move, how can I fix this?</span>
                <br>
                <span class="ans">This is likely due to the fact that the application does not have permission to control other windows. To give it access, go to <span class="settings-directory">System Settings > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility</span> and add + enable MultiController.</span>

                <span class="qtn">Does MultiController work with custom in-game controls?</span>
                <br>
                <span class="ans">Yes and no. For Mirror, MultiController takes your input and outputs it directly to all of your ToonTown windows. So if you only use Mirror mode, you should be good to go with custom controls.</span>
                <br>
                <span class="ans">Unfortunately, the way Multi works is by taking your input and outputting the default controls. If you leave any controls unchanged, they will still work, but any controls that were changed will not.</span>
